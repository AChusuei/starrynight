#### Contributing  

StarrySky needs a few basic things to integrate new frameworks.

1.  We need to know how to install the framework.
2.  We need to know how to launch the framework.
3.  We need a set of sample tests to get people started.
4.  We need to configure the framework to use the sample tests.

This is significantly more lightweight than what's required to integrate frameworks with Velocity.  If you can do the above and submit a pull request, it will probably get into StarrySky.
