      <h1>StarryNight</h1>
      <h4>Meteor Testing and Scaffolding Tool</h4>

      <h2>What is StarryNight?</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>
        StarryNight is a managment tool for use in building and testing <a href="http://www.meteor.com/">Meteor.js</a> applications.  It's main intent is for creating HIPAA and FDA compliant Meteor apps (but it's useful for a lot more than that).  It's a direct result of 2 years of working on the <a href="http://github.com/awatson1978/meteor-cookbook.git">Meteor Cookbook</a> and the <a href="http://clinical.meteor.com">Clinical Meteor Track</a>, and makes extensive use of <a href="http://nightwatchjs.org/">Nightwatch.js</a>.
      </p>


      <h2>Installation</h2>
      <hr>
      {{#prism language="bash"}}
          npm install starrynight -g
      {{/prism}}
      <p>
        StarryNight now supports dynamic Npm prefixing, which means that, in theory, it should install correctly on Linux and Windows.  Log a ticket if you have any problems.   Better yet, give us a shout-out if you actually *do* get it installed on environments other than Mac.  @awatson1978, forums.meteor.com, etc.

      <div class="horizontally-padded">
        <p>
          <b>help</b><br>
          Prints out some information on commands that can be run and what arguments they take.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>display-env</b><br>

        <p>
          <b>audit-permissions</b><br>
          Primarily for any EACCESS errors, or if you find yourself running commands with 'sudo'.  Will modify file permissions on relevant files.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>scaffold</b><br>
          Copies parts of the Reference Scaffold into your application.  Will overwrite existing files.  Should be run from the application root, where the .meteor directory is located.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>clone</b><br>
          Clones a github url into the current directory.  Not very smart. Does a raw clone, with any ancillary documentation in the github repository, such as the README.md.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>create</b><br>
          Refactors the files from a directory into a package in the /packages directory.  Must be run from the application root where the .meteor directory is located.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>pattern</b><br>
          A 'smart-clone' which looks into a github repository for directories in the Reference Scaffold, and patches those files into your app.  Overwrites existing files.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>rename</b><br>
          Renames directories and files according to the pattern you specify.  Is not case sensitive.  The optional directory argument will scope the rename operation within the specified subdirectory.  Run in the application parent directory to include tests in the /test directory.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>find-and-replace</b><br>
          Basically the same as the rename command, but opens up files and replaces occurrences of the specified pattern in the code itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>refactor</b><br>
          Runs both a rename and refactor command.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>survey</b><br>

        <p>
          <b>extract-tests-for</b><br>
          Extracts ids from the specified file, and generate a Nightwatch command script.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>generate-release-json</b><br>
          Generate a release.json file for use with `meteor publish-release` so you can publish a track.  (Advanced tool.)
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>generate-travis</b><br>
          Add a .travis.yml file to your application to get started with continuous integration.  Command assumes that you're using the Reference Scaffold, and your app is located in a /webapp directory.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>generate-autoconfig</b><br>
          Generates the <b>.meteor/nightwatch.json</b> config file for Nightwatch to use.  Parses the application and searches for .test directories, which allows you to keep tests with their associated components.
        </p>



        <!-- <hr>
        <p>
          <b>clean</b><br>

        </p>
        <p>
          <b>connect</b><br>
          There's a few services that people commonly like to connect their applications to, such as google-analytics and uservoice, which only require a single file copied into their app.      This will get those files in place without having to research things.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>install-dev-tools</b><br>
          Installs common development tools for Meteor, including Atom.io.

      </div>



      <h2>Generic Flags</h2>
      <hr>
      <div class="horizontally-padded">
        <p>
          <b>--root</b><br>
          StarryNight generally expects to be run from the root of an application, and most commands will default to running relative from the root of the application.  The <b>--root</b> flag will adjust where a command runs relative to.  Generally used for restricting a command to running from a subdirectory.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>--framework</b><br>
          StarryNight supports a half-dozen testing frameworks; and defaults to an integrated version that uses parts from each.  If a command supports the <b>--framework</b> flag, it will restrict the command to only modifying files associated with that particular framework.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>--boilerplate</b><br>
          A boilerplate is a generic application scaffold that's specific to some functionality.  A boilerplate differs from a package in that it's expected you'll use a boilerplate as a starting-off point.  It's not a self-contained piece of code.  It's more like a self-contained starting point for future code development.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>--from</b><br>
          Many commands involve copying, moving, or renaming things from one location to another.  This flag generally accepts either a relative url path or a string, depending on context.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>--to</b><br>
          Many commands involve copying, moving, or renaming things from one location to another.  This flag generally accepts either a relative url path or a string, depending on context.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>--url</b><br>
          Specifies that the following URL should be used as an input to the command.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>--mode</b><br>
          Specifies a testing mode for FDA review.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Global Flags</h2>
      <hr>
      <div class="horizontally-padded">
        <p>
          <b>--debug</b><br>
          Prints out debug information.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>--trace</b><br>
          Prints out even more detailed debugging information.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Testing Modes</h2>
      <hr>
        <p>
          StarryNight combines functionality from a number of testing libraries, some of which overlap.  Rather than specifying a particular test framework to use; it's often benefitial to specify which part of the architecture you want to test.  Which is what Test Modes provide.  A way to specify which part of the architecture your reviewing for FDA compliance.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>all</b><br>
          Alias for running both validation and verification tests.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>validation</b><br>
          Also known as black-box or acceptance testing.  Alias for running both client-validation and package-validation tests.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>verification</b><br>
          Also known as unit-testing or integration testing.  Runs client, package, and server unit tests using TinyTest, Mocha, and Nightwatch.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>package-verification</b><br>
          Unit testing of Meteor packages using TinyTest.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>package-validation</b><br>

        </p>
        <p>
          <b>server-verification</b><br>

        </p>
        <p>
          <b>client-verification</b><br>

        <p>
          <b>client-validation</b><br>
          Acceptance testing of Meteor client code using an automated browser controlled by Selenium.
        </p>




      <h2>Client Verification Testing</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>
        More commonly known as unit-testing, Verification Testing doesn't test the Document Object Model (DOM) that the user interacts with.  Rather, it inspects the underlying javascript functions on the client.  Client-side verification testing can also test Meteor methods on the server.  Consider an ultra-simple Meteor app that has the following code.
      </p>
      {{#prism language="javascript" class="line-numbers"}}
        if(Meteor.isClient()){
          Session.setDefault("loggedInUser", "Jane Doe")
        }
        if(Meteor.isServer()){
          Meteor.methods({
            testMethod:function(){
               return "abc";
            },
            testMethodWithInput:function(value){
               return value * 2;
            }
          });
        }
      {{/prism}}

      <p>
        Our Nightwatch script to test the above code would look something like the following:
      </p>
      {{#prism language="javascript" class="line-numbers" data-line="7, 15-20"}}
        module.exports = {
          "Check Client Session" : function (client) {

            var sessionBar = false;
            client
              .url("http://localhost:3000/list/users")
              .checkSession("loggedInUser", "Jane Doe")
              .end();
          },
          "Check Server Methods" : function (client) {

            var sessionBar = false;
            client
              .url("http://localhost:3000/list/users")
              .meteorCall("testMethod", false, function(error, result){
                client.assert.equal(result, "abc");
              })
              .meteorCall("testMethodWithInput", 3, function(error, result){
                client.assert.equal(result, 6);
              })
              .end();
          }
        };
      {{/prism}}


      <h2>Reference Scaffold</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>
        To get the most out of StarryNight, it's best to understand the structure of the Reference Scaffold, which is a sort of default app that StarryNight uses to structure apps.  Some people will object to the design assumptions that the Reference Scaffold makes, and that's okay.  That's what the refactoring tools in StarryNight are for:  it's assumed that, at some point, you'll stop wanting to follow the scaffold, and begin custom modifying parts of it.  If anybody wants to make changes to the underlying scaffold itself (ie to add angular, famo.us, or react scaffolds), they're free to fork StarryNight and write their own scaffolding utility or submit pull-requests.
      </p>
      {{#prism language="bash"}}
        /media
        /docs
        /design
        /data
        /webapp
        /webapp/client

        /webapp/tests/nightwatch/commands
        /webapp/tests/nightwatch/walkthroughs
        .travis.yml
      {{/prism}}

      <p>
        The Reference Scaffold makes quite a few opinionated assumptions about how to structure an app...  everything from how to integrate analytics to which continuous-integration environment to run.  You're welcome to ignore any part, delete components, or not run the scaffolding commands in the first place.  But if you just want to get an app up-and-running, and are willing to follow some standard conventions, StarryNight will do a whole lot of the heavy-lifting for you.  But you should know what you're getting, and that begins by looking at the default directory structure of what you would get if you ran all the scaffolding components.
      </p>




      <!-- <h2>Continous Integration</h2>

      <h2>About The Name</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>
        Why 'StarryNight'?  Basically because it started out as a launcher for the Nightwatch testing framework, which was named after a Rembrandt painting.   I was looking for a piece of art that was go along with Meteor, Atmosphere, Nightwatch, and...  StarryNight was an obvious choice.
      </p>

      <h2>History</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>
        StarryNight was originally a launcher for the Nightwatch testing framework.  Somewhere along the way it seemed like a good idea to copy test files into a user's application.  Then it seemed like a good idea to run those tests on a continuous integration server.  And if we could copy some tests files into the app, maybe it would be a good idea to be able to scaffold some application boilerplate into an app as well.  And then it just became a place to add all the tools and scripts that Meteor doesn't include by default.
      </p>
